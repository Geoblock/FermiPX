# FermiPX
Fermi paradox solution simulator for the Milky Way Galaxy. 
The input data are taken from the Hipparcos and Gaia astronomical cataloque
and converted to SQLite tables to quantify other galavoxels with the size of 1000*1000ly. 

The simulator is using the convolution of birth and death for various spectral star classes   
of habitable exoplanets with supposed intelligent life recalculating Voronoi mesh and excluding voids. 

Common requirements: Windows 10/11 32/64 bits.
